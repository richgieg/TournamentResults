# Tournament Results

This is the second project in my pursuit of my Full-Stack Web Developer
Nanodegree from Udacity. Following is Udacity's description for this project:

"In this project, youâ€™ll be writing a Python module that uses the PostgreSQL
database to keep track of players and matches in a game tournament. The game
tournament will use the Swiss system for pairing up players in each round:
players are not eliminated, and each player should be paired with another player
with the same number of wins, or as close as possible. This project has two
parts: defining the database schema (SQL table definitions), and writing the
code that will use it."
